# ChainChat AN AI DeFi Strategy Engine

## 🎯 What This Does
Control DeFi strategies on Stacks using simple English commands like "start safe strategy" or "exit all positions".

## 💡 The Problem
DeFi is complicated. Users need to:
- Understand multiple protocols
- Monitor positions constantly
- Make complex decisions about when to enter/exit
- Manage risk manually

## ✨ The Solution
Type simple commands and let the system handle the complexity:
- `"start safe strategy"` → Automatically starts low-risk yield farming
- `"exit all positions"` → Closes everything safely
- `"set risk high"` → Switches to higher-yield strategies
- `"show portfolio"` → Displays current positions and performance

## 🏗️ How It Works

### 1. Smart Contracts (Clarity)
- **strategy-vault.clar**: Safely holds your STX
- **strategy-engine.clar**: Executes strategies based on commands
- **alex-connector.clar**: Connects to ALEX DeFi protocol

### 2. AI Command Parser
Converts English to strategy actions:
```
"start safe strategy" → strategy_id: 1, risk: low, protocol: alex
"exit everything" → action: close_all_positions
```

### 3. Simple Frontend
- Command input box (type what you want)
- Portfolio dashboard (see your positions)
- Performance tracking (see how you're doing)

## 🚀 Supported Commands (MVP)

### Strategy Commands
- `"start safe strategy"` - Low-risk ALEX yield farming
- `"start growth strategy"` - Higher-yield ALEX strategies  
- `"exit all positions"` - Close all strategies safely

### Risk Management
- `"set risk low"` - Conservative approach
- `"set risk medium"` - Balanced approach
- `"set risk high"` - Aggressive approach

### Information
- `"show portfolio"` - Current positions and balance
- `"show performance"` - Strategy performance metrics

## 🔒 Safety Features
- **Maximum Position Limits**: Can't risk more than you set
- **Stop Loss**: Automatically exits if losses exceed threshold
- **Emergency Stop**: Pause everything with one command
- **Secure Vault**: Your funds stay in your control

## 💰 How It Makes Money
- Earns yield through ALEX DeFi protocols
- Automatically compounds returns
- Manages risk to protect your principal
- Saves time by automating strategy execution

## 🎮 Getting Started

### 1. Connect Your Wallet
```javascript
// Connect Stacks wallet
const wallet = await connectStacks();
```

### 2. Deposit Funds
```javascript
// Deposit STX to strategy vault
await depositToVault(1000); // 1000 STX
```

### 3. Start Earning
```javascript
// Type command in frontend
"start safe strategy"
```

### 4. Monitor Performance
Check dashboard for:
- Current yield
- Active strategies
- Risk metrics
- Total returns

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Smart Contracts**: Clarity (Stacks blockchain)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript + HTML/CSS
- **Protocol Integration**: ALEX DeFi
- **AI**: Rule-based command parsing (simple but effective)
